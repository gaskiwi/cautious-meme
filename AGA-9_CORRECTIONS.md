# AGA-9 Corrections Applied

## Date: 2025-10-14

## Corrections Made Based on User Feedback

### Issue Identified

The initial implementation had incorrect DOF (Degrees of Freedom) specifications:

**Initial (Incorrect):**
- Type A (Bar Robot): 6 DOF (incorrectly assumed 2 spherical joints)
- Type B (Sphere Robot): 3 DOF

**Corrected:**
- Type A (Bar Robot): **3 DOF** (1 ball-and-socket joint = 1 spherical joint)
- Type B (Sphere Robot): **2 DOF** (rolling control)

### Rationale for Correction

1. **Type A (Bar Robot)**: 
   - Has ONE central ball-and-socket joint
   - This provides 3 degrees of freedom (rotation around X, Y, Z axes)
   - The two bars extend from the central joint but are controlled by this single spherical joint

2. **Type B (Sphere Robot)**:
   - Rolling control requires only 2 DOF
   - Typically: direction of roll and magnitude/speed

## Technical Impact

### Network Architecture Changes

**Action Head Output Dimensions:**
```python
# Before
type_a_action_head = nn.Linear(256, 6)  # 2 spherical joints × 3 DOF
type_b_action_head = nn.Linear(256, 3)  # 3 DOF rolling

# After
type_a_action_head = nn.Linear(256, 3)  # 1 spherical joint × 3 DOF
type_b_action_head = nn.Linear(256, 2)  # 2 DOF rolling
```

### Parameter Count Impact

The correction reduces the number of parameters in the action heads:

**Type A Action Head:**
- Before: 256 × 6 + 6 = 1,542 parameters
- After: 256 × 3 + 3 = 771 parameters
- Reduction: 771 parameters

**Type B Action Head:**
- Before: 256 × 3 + 3 = 771 parameters
- After: 256 × 2 + 2 = 514 parameters
- Reduction: 257 parameters

**Total Network:**
- Before: ~660,000 parameters
- After: ~659,000 parameters
- Reduction: ~1,000 parameters (negligible)

### Functional Impact

1. **More Accurate Control**: The network now properly matches the physical constraints of each robot type
2. **Reduced Action Space**: Smaller action dimensionality may lead to faster learning
3. **Better Efficiency**: Fewer parameters in action heads means less computation

## State Representation (Unchanged)

The input state dimensions remain correct:

**Type A (Bar Robot): 51 dimensions**
- Base sphere state: 13
- Bar 1 state: 13
- Bar 2 state: 13
- Ball joint state: 6
- Joint connection info: 6

**Type B (Sphere Robot): 13 dimensions**
- Sphere state: 13

## Action Space Specifications

### Corrected Action Spaces

**Type A (Bar Robot) - 3 DOF:**
```python
[
    theta_x,   # Rotation around X-axis
    theta_y,   # Rotation around Y-axis
    theta_z,   # Rotation around Z-axis
]
```

**Type B (Sphere Robot) - 2 DOF:**
```python
[
    roll_direction,  # Direction of rolling motion
    roll_torque,     # Magnitude/torque of roll
]
```

## Backward Compatibility

These changes are **breaking changes** for any code that was using the network with the old action dimensions. However, since this is the initial implementation phase, there should be no existing trained models affected.

### Migration Notes

If you had any early experiments:
1. The network architecture parameters have changed
2. Saved models will not be compatible
3. Re-train from scratch with the corrected architecture

## Verification

All files have been updated consistently:
- ✅ Core network implementation
- ✅ Policy wrappers
- ✅ Agent factory
- ✅ Documentation (technical and user-facing)
- ✅ Examples
- ✅ Environment notes

## Testing

The test suite (`tests/test_robot_network.py`) remains valid as it uses the default parameters, which have been updated. The tests will now validate the corrected architecture.

## Summary

The corrections ensure that:
1. **Type A robots** properly reflect having ONE spherical joint (3 DOF)
2. **Type B robots** properly reflect rolling control (2 DOF)
3. All documentation is consistent and accurate
4. The implementation matches the physical reality of the robot designs

These corrections were applied comprehensively across all relevant files to maintain consistency throughout the codebase.
